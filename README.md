[First Person Camera](https://github.com/Asu4ni/CitiesSkylines-FPSCamera) is a lightweight mod that attaches an extra **Camera Controller** to the original [Cities: Skylines](https://www.citiesskylines.com) game to enable users to view their cities in first person perspective.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Asu4ni/CitiesSkylines-FPSCamera/wiki) page for instructions and guide on how to use the mode as well as how to contribute to the development.
